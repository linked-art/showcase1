## Georgia O'Keeffe Showcase

This repository is for managing discussion and collecting data and documents towards the creation of a showcase on the topic of Georgia O'Keeffe and her network of objects, people, places and activities.

Sample data sets have been contributed by institutions participating in the development of Linked Art, and can be found in the data folder, organized by institution. Contributors include Getty (getty), Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields (ima), Met (met), Museum of Modern Art (moma), Philadelphia Museum of Art (pma), Princeton University Museum of Art (puam), Rijksmuseum (rma), Victoria & Albert Museum, (vam), and Yale Center for British Art (ycba).

For the most part, the URIs referenced in the sample JSON-LD documents are not live URIs. They have been created for the purpose of showcasing the developing Linked Art model and to make connections between contributed data sets. Source data files are also available in this repository, in varying formats provided by the contributors or as-captured from their collection sites.
